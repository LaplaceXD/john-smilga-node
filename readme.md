# John Smilga Tutorials

This repo just compiles all the projects that I made following through the
[Node.js Tutorial of John Smilga](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-tutorial-and-projects-course). I need
a bit of a refresher for node, thus I'm taking up this course. I might also learn something new along the
way, such as best practices, since I did not delve in that deep in my last session with node.
